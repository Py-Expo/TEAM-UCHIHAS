# IPL 2024 Winner Prediction

## Overview
This project is dedicated to developing a predictive model using machine learning techniques to forecast the winner of the IPL 2024 tournament. By analyzing historical datasets containing match results, player performances, team statistics, venue details, and other relevant information, the goal is to build a robust prediction system that accurately predicts the outcome of the IPL 2024 season. This predictive application aims to provide insights into potential winners based on past trends, player form, team strategies, and various influencing factors, thereby enhancing the excitement and engagement of cricket enthusiasts and stakeholders during one of the most popular sporting events.

## Requirements
To run the IPL 2024 Winner Prediction system, the following dependencies are required:

- requests==2.31.0
- scikit-learn==1.3.2
- streamlit==1.27.2
- pandas==1.0.4
- numpy==1.17.2
- seaborn==0.10.1
- matplotlib==3.2.1
- urllib3==1.24.2
- xgboost==0.90
- django (if a web application is desired)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Solution
The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical datasets containing IPL match results, player performances, team statistics, venue details, etc., to serve as the basis for training the prediction model.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering to extract relevant features for prediction.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the datasets to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations between variables, and identify patterns that may influence the outcome of IPL matches.
4. **Model Building**: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost, and train the model using historical data. Utilize techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using validation techniques such as cross-validation or train-test split to assess its accuracy and generalization performance.
6. **Prediction**: Deploy the trained model to predict the winner of the IPL 2024 tournament based on input data, which may include team lineups, player form, match venue, and other relevant factors.
7. **Deployment**: Develop a user-friendly interface using Streamlit or Django framework to interact with the prediction model. Users can input the required data and get predictions for the IPL 2024 winner.
8. **Feedback and Iteration**: Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to improve the prediction model further. Iteratively refine the model based on new data and insights gained from user feedback.

## Usage
To run the IPL 2024 Winner Prediction system, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the Streamlit web application using the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
3. Access the web application in your browser and interact with the prediction model to get insights into the potential winner of the IPL 2024 season.
